Hi! My name is Aly Tan. I'm a 4th-year undergraduate student at UCLA, majoring in Statistics and Data Science. My academic interests include statistical modeling, data visualization, and exploring how data influences decisions in everyday life. I’m also working toward becoming a math teacher, and I hope to use my background in data to help students understand mathematical ideas in a clear, engaging, and relevant way.
